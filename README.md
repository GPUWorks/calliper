Level editor based on the Polycode framework.

# What happened to the Crowbar editor?
As of the current date (05/09/15), the Qt3D 2.0 module is too quirky for me to use properly - there are several problems relating to scene entities not being updated when they should be, for example. The Polycode framework is being used instead to drive the 3D graphics of the editor.

There is also a tool that already exists for Source called Crowbar, which is used for decompiling and recompiling models. To avoid confusion, the Crowbar level editor has been renamed to Calliper.

The original Crowbar repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/x6herbius/crowbar)
